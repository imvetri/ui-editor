## UI editor

UI editor is a component library builder. It helps to build components and generate framework code if you know to write jsx, css, events and reducers. The generated code is readable, debuggable, editable. The tool is scalable to any UI framework of your choice and works flawlessly for React js.

## Why code generator is useful.

1. The cost of writing and maintaining the code generator is less than the cost of writing and maintaining the repetition that it is replacing.
2. The consistency gained by using a code generator will reduce errors to a degree that makes it worthwhile.
3. The extra problem of debugging generated code will not make debugging inefficient enough to outweigh the benefits from 1 and 2.
