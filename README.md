## introduction

ui-editor is a design to code tool. 

I couldn't catch up js-community at one point in my career, because something didn't make sense to me or i couldn't memorise it well. I was out of challenges to keep mind occupied. this has been my hobby, to build and use at my work, to save time. it started as good quality, in solving the problem, but got deviated in building to a final goal many times due to office environment change or living place change. for nearly seven and half years. this idea had been in my mind as a dim idea since i got job in frontend, ~10-11 years back, and it made much sense year by year.
last year nov, i left my job and started working on this, from scratch, again.

## getting started

1. open the tool: open imvetri.github.io/ui-editor or start local server in 3000, download the repo files, open localhost:3000/html.html
2. import your designs: click the 'import' button and select your design file.
3. convert: right click a design box and click "Result".
4. preview and Test: review the prototype in the preview window and test the interactions.
5. you can use this part of your dev server and build apps in real time or you can set a toggle between html.html and result.html , merge them in a single file, to build apps in production or you can set this up in internal network for designers to design and you to check result in production.

## warnings / notes: 

1. to add more design token, currently there is a bug. "Wouldn't take long to fix it. Its just a design. Priority is the app functionality" - A web cant use this excuse anymore. Neither I can. "But customers are waiting". I totally understand. but for that, whatever is there is, lets share, take feedback.


## conclusion

Most open source tools are heavy on stack, so code generation is tricky - penpot
Figma, appsmith and other proprietary tools are influenced by AI to gain investors, hence they wont focus this challenge.
the technique is integratable with other existing tools.
uses own framework designed for this particular challenge.
uses html, few js files. no bundlers, no package.json.
crisp solution, light weight, easy for maintainance.
