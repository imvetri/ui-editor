## About

Welcome to **ui-editor**, where I strive to make the machine work for me, not the other way around. This cutting-edge, web-based interface builder, powered by ReactJS, is your key to rapid application development. Forget wrestling with framework syntax â€“ focus on building components using jsx, state, and events.

What began as an experimental tool for readable code generation has evolved into a powerhouse for instant rendering. Witness its capabilities in action through the [recorded video](https://vimeo.com/464104903) and the mesmerizing [drag-and-drop feature](https://vimeo.com/642968726). Not to mention, it allows you to edit styles â€“ talk about intriguing!

And that's not all! I've integrated react-flow for an infinite canvas. Check out the mind-blowing demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfe6Qobn8vo).
