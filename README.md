    ui-editor is a web based interface builder built using reactjs. Its main purpose is to build interfaces for rapid application development.
  </p>
 <p>
    It started as an experimental tool to test readable code generation and it was a success. Since then, I have been experimenting with it to test instant renderer and it was a success too.

Most recently I tried to build a self editable compoment that can create children of itself and it worked. Checkit out the <a href="https://vimeo.com/464104903">recorded video</a> . It also comes with an option to edit the styles and it's interesting.

### Demo - https://imvetri.github.io/ui-editor/
### Recorded demos
Code generation - https://vimeo.com/386239546 - this feature speeds up component creation and maintenance duration.

Recursive component - https://vimeo.com/464104903 - an attempted to test whether a component can be modified using itself. Just a component I built to see if it works.

### Feedbacks
<div>
  <h4> This happened after I gave some demos</h4>
<ol>
  <li>The tool is great, I like the code generation part but the tool needs little love</li>
  
  <li>We don't need fancy tools</li>
  
  <li>I do not know what is great other than code generation</li>
  
  <li>What tool does is not important, what is important is how good you present it, I do not see nothing great about it, have you got any pages built using this?</li>
</ol>

Regardless, If you think you can help this project, jump in, send a PR. If you need help, contact me at my twitter or start a discussion in issues page. This project lacks organised content and undocumented features, but you can correct it.
